        "question": "Who developed TradeTrust?",
        "answer": "<a href=\"https://www.tech.gov.sg/\">GovTech Singapore</a> developed TradeTrust in cooperation with the TradeTrust Consortium."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is TradeTrust?",
        "answer": "TradeTrust is the umbrella trademark under which we have released a few key components: <br><ol><li>An <a href=\"https://github.com/OpenCerts/open-certificate\">open source schema</a> for publishing educational credentials </li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/OpenCerts/certificate-cli\"> A set of tools</a> for generating cryptographic protections for educational credentials </li><li>This online website for verifying the authenticity of OpenCerts files.</li></ol>"
      },
      {
        "question": "Where do I get an TradeTrust document?",
        "answer": "TradeTrust is currently in the early stages of progressive rollout. If you wish to know whether your educational institute supports OpenCerts, please contact their administrative office."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is my personal data safe on the blockchain?",
        "answer": "Records of the document and personal data are not published on the blockchain. A hash is generated from the document and is used to prove that the document is legitimate. The process of computing the hash from the document is not reversible. Since the hash is the only information published into the blockchain, no personal information can be obtained from content on the blockchain."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why is TradeTrust backed by blockchain technology?",
        "answer": "Using blockchain, we can greatly reduce the barrier to entry of publishing cryptographically protected data, as compared to currently existing costly proprietary software. In addition, a public blockchain is owned and maintained by the community and is easily accessible by anyone. As a result, there is no need to run or maintain services to verify TradeTrust."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why use the Ethereum blockchain?",
        "answer": "Ethereum is the blockchain network with the largest developer base, as well as having a large number of participants securing the network."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I send my TradeTrust document to someone?",
        "answer": "You may use the share button that is visible when you view your document, or you can simply email the TradeTrust file to them."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why can't I print the document?",
        "answer": "Printing the document discards all the advanced cryptographic protections we have built into TradeTrust, hence printed documents are not to be considered authentic."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens if I modify the TradeTrust file?",
        "answer": "The modified document will fail validation and show up as having been tampered with."
      },
      {
        "question": "What does it mean by Signature?",
        "answer": "In every properly issued TradeTrust document file, there is a hash-based message authentication code which cryptographically certifies that the content of the document has not been altered. If you would like to know more about the technical nitty-gritty of how this works, check out our <a href=\"https://docs.opencerts.io\">technical documentation</a>."

    "faq": [
      {
        "question": "What does it mean by Unascertained Issuer?",
        "answer": "TradeTrust has to maintain a list of identified issuing institutes in order to detect fraudulent issuing institutes masquerading as legitimate ones. At this point in time, it is not unlikely that a legitimate issuing institute is not on our list of recognised institutions. If you are sure that your document is from a legitimate issuer, contact the institute directly."
      },
      {
        "question": "What does it mean by Ethereum Blockchain?",
        "answer": "The Ethereum Blockchain is a publicly usable distributed ledger based on blockchain technology. You can think of it as a publicly readable database."
      },
      {
        "question": "What does it mean by Revoked?",
        "answer": "The issuer has explicitly published a notice of revocation for this document and it is no longer a valid document."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this safe to use? Can't anyone just copy my document file and pass off as me?",
        "answer": "Yes, the document file can trivially be duplicated. However, the recipient's name in the document cannot be altered without failing our verification process. Thus it is extremely important that the person doing the verification ensures that the recipient indicated in the document is actually the entity presenting the document. For more advanced institutions, there is the possibility of using Distributed IDs to associate the document recipient's public key for further authentication using public/private key signing in the future."
