TradeTrust supports the notarisation of trade documents using open-source solution which allows end users receiving the documents to verify their provenance and authenticity. 

In addition, TradeTrust is also aligned to the requirements of the Model Law of Electronic Transferable Records (MLETR) which Singapore has adopted into its legislation this year. While MLETR lays out the conditions to be met before a digital record can be deemed as an electronic transferable record (ETR), TradeTrust provides the technical methods designed to satisfy the conditions.
