The v1 prototype is designed for notarisation of trade documents using open-source solution leveraging on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). This allows end users receiving the document to verify the provenance and integrity of the document. The use of such technology offers several advantages.

1. There is no proprietary lock-in; solution will be open-source which lowers barriers of entry to market
2. There is no centralised infrastructure (governance/sovereignty); thus, there would not be any single entity in charge of the verification/data that eliminates the trust concern of which authority will have all the trade information in trade world especially when cross-border trading is involved
3. Elevates automated trade document processing; allows for any parties in the supply chain to issue trade documents, and for anyone to quickly check the validity of a digital trade documents. This will in time make trade facilitation easier and smoother for the whole supply chain workflow
4. Connecting the disconnected world (digital standard); allowing isolated eco-systems to be interoperable
