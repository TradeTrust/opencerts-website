For Transferable documents, TradeTrust has been developed to meet the requirements of the UNCITRAL MLETR  which has been adopted into Singapore’s legislation  in 2021. TradeTrust’s open-source code is freely available and can be easily integrated into any existing system of businesses and solution providers to create and verify documents in support of viable use cases. 

TradeTrust has partnered with authoritative International Organisations such as UN/CEFACT and ISO to ensure that TradeTrust technical methods are compatible with existing standards and where appropriate, drive their acceptance as an international standard through the organisations’ respective open and neutral standards development processes. In addition, TradeTrust is advocated as the key interoperability mechanism for trade in several notable publications by World Trade Organisation(WTO) and International Chamber of Commerce(ICC).
