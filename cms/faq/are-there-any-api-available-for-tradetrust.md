The APIs currently available are for verification of documents: 
1. <https://verify.tradetrust.io>
2. <https://verify-ropsten.tradetrust.io>

The creation (deployment) of document store/token registry, issuance of documents, and title transfer will require private keys. Hence, these APIs are not available in TradeTrust.
