TradeTrust can support **all** digital documents. For trade documents, it supports the following 2 categories of documents:

1.  **Transferable documents:** Trade documents that entitle the holder to claim the performance of an obligation or ownership (e.g. bills of lading, bills of exchange, etc.) and the selected blockchain needs to be able to track and transfer ownership of the trade document. 

2.  **Normal documents/Verifiable documents:** Other non-transferable trade documents that do not confer ownership (e.g. invoices, packing list, certificate of origin, etc.). These trade documents can be verified for its authenticity, integrity and provenance.
