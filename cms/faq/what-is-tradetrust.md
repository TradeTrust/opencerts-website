TradeTrust is a digital utility that comprises a set of globally-accepted standards and frameworks that connects governments and businesses to a public blockchain to enable trusted interoperability and exchanges of electronic trade documents across digital platforms. The four key components of TradeTrust are:

1. **Legal harmonisation** to ensure legal validity of the digital trade documents across various countries and jurisdictions;
2. **Standards development** to promote the use of internationally accepted standards to facilitate the interoperability of digital documents exchanged across different solutions and ecosystems;
3. An **accreditation structure** to provide a set of internationally accepted rules and policies to certify solutions to meet the requirements of the law; and
4. An set of **open-source software** that can easily integrate backend solutions to the TradeTrust network.
