Developed and pioneered by the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), TradeTrust was designed to address the challenges of paper-based international trade. 

TradeTrust is a set of international standards and frameworks supported by open-source software that utilises blockchain-powered technology to digitalise the end-to-end processing of trade documents to ensure that documents issued can be verified in terms of their source and authenticity. 

Through a holistic framework made of four key components – legal harmonisation, accreditation structure, standards development and open-source software – TradeTrust seeks to make digitalized trade robust, legally recognisable, and inclusive for all stakeholders in the ecosystem, resulting in faster, simpler and more secure trade processes.
