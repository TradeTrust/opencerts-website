Developed and pioneered by the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), TradeTrust was designed to address the challenges of paper-based international trade. 

TradeTrust, which is built upon OpenAttestation , comprises globally accepted standards and frameworks that allow governments and businesses to endorse, exchange and verify documents and effect title transfer across different digital platforms seamlessly. 

TradeTrust can be utilised to digitalise two categories of documents used in cross-border trade: 

(1) Verifiable Documents such as the Certificate of Origin where the provenance and authenticity of the e-document can be easily verified by any party; and 

(2) Transferable Documents such as Bill of Lading where the e-document’s title ownership can be transferred from one party to another. 

For Transferable documents, TradeTrust has been developed to meet the requirements of the UNCITRAL MLETR  which has been adopted into Singapore’s legislation  in 2021. TradeTrust’s open-source code is freely available and can be easily integrated into any existing system of businesses and solution providers to create and verify documents in support of viable use cases. 

TradeTrust has partnered with authoritative International Organisations such as UN/CEFACT and ISO to ensure that TradeTrust technical methods are compatible with existing standards and where appropriate, drive their acceptance as an international standard through the organisations’ respective open and neutral standards development processes. In addition, TradeTrust is advocated as the key interoperability mechanism for trade in several notable publications by WTO and ICC.
