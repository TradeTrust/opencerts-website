Currently, TradeTrust can be connected to 2 different public blockchain networks: 

1. Ethereum 
2. Polygon

Below are the estimated fees (USD) computed as at 2 Feb 2023 for a typical series of NFT transactions related to an electronic Bill of Lading (eBL), from its issuance to surrender: 

* Estimated Fees on Ethereum: < USD $20 
* Estimated Fees on Polygon:  < USD $0.16

Do note that the cost estimated above involves the whole chain of endorsements (NFT transactions) for a Transferable document like eBL. This cost is expected to be shared across multiple transaction parties in the eBL value chain.
