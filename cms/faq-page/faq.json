  "body": "#### General\n\n##### What is TradeTrust?\n\nChanging some text here to test:\n\n1. **Legal harmonisation** to ensure legal validity of the digital trade documents across various countries and jurisdictions;\n2. **Standards development** to promote the use of internationally accepted standards to facilitate the interoperability of digital documents exchanged across different solutions and ecosystems;\n3. An **accreditation structure** to provide a set of internationally accepted rules and policies to certify solutions to meet the requirements of the law; and\n4. An set of **open-source software** that can easily integrate backend solutions to the TradeTrust network.\n\n##### What is the expected cost for companies to develop a Tradetrust node?\n\nThe TradeTrust software is to be distributed to the industry for free under the open source licensing terms. The industry will then integrate the software to their platforms or digital solutions to connect to the TradeTrust public blockchain network.\n\n##### Can existing technologies on the market be made to become interoperable with TradeTrust?\n\nTradeTrust digital utility will be interoperable with most digital solutions out there as we intend to simplify the technical integration work using standardised API calls.\n\n##### What is government’s role?\n\nWe observed that industry players by themselves are already actively looking at ways to leverage innovative technologies to address inefficiencies of cross-border trade. At the same time, these companies also recognise the importance of a government-led initiative like TradeTrust that will tackle the problem at areas that are beyond them, like legal recognition and G2G mutual recognition. We need to work closely with the industry stakeholders on few areas: engagements for feedback, participation in standards development and the conduct of pilots.\n\n##### What is the industry’s role?\n\nIndustry buy-in and adoption across the supply chain is required in order to truly reap the benefits of paperless trade. As a trading transaction may involve many stakeholders, the buy-in from all parties to create the circle of trust to carry out paperless trade transactions is important.\n\n##### Where can I find the TradeTrust source codes?\n\nPlease download from <https://github.com/TradeTrust>.\n\n##### What are the main features of TradeTrust?\n\nThe v1 prototype is designed for notarisation of trade documents using open-source solution leveraging on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). This allows end users receiving the document to verify the provenance and integrity of the document. The use of such technology offers several advantages.\n\n1. There is no proprietary lock-in; solution will be open-source which lowers barriers of entry to market\n2. There is no centralised infrastructure (governance/sovereignty); thus, there would not be any single entity in charge of the verification/data that eliminates the trust concern of which authority will have all the trade information in trade world especially when cross-border trading is involved\n3. Elevates automated trade document processing; allows for any parties in the supply chain to issue trade documents, and for anyone to quickly check the validity of a digital trade documents. This will in time make trade facilitation easier and smoother for the whole supply chain workflow\n4. Connecting the disconnected world (digital standard); allowing isolated eco-systems to be interoperable\n\n##### I’d like to be notified with the latest updates on TradeTrust.
